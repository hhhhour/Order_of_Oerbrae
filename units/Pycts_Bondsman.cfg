    description= _ "Bondsmans are some of the most versatile troops of the Pycts and though expected to be proficient with swords, they are most famed for their use of the Skeggox, a long bearded axe. Typically accompanied by a shield, for use in a shield wall should the need occur.

They are also seasoned with a thrown axe, more through drunken competitions at festivals than through their rigorous training and, although considered dishonourable, this skill can be extended to the battlefield."
