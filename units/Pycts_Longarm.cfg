	description= _ "The Longarm are the base of the Pyctish ranks, making up a large part of any battle. All Pycts are required to own weapons, and as such the lower ranks, like the Longarm, are poorly equipped. The spear is by far the cheapest weapon to make, using very little metal, a scarce resource on The Sheets.

Shields are another common weapon, having to be little more than a wooden circle with a metal boss to protect the wielder's hand. Some decorate their shields with bones of their slain, or spikes of metal. Finally the trusted Seax is always to hand should all else fail."
