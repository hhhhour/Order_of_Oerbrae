But those that do quickly learn to use special pastes and powders, the recipes for which have been passed down through generations. These concoctions have been known to cause the flames to stick to their enemy and even leap and burst before them. For this reason, they have often been called magi. But neither their demeanor nor their precision live up to the title."
