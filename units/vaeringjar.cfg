    description=_ "The Væringjar live over the mountains beyond the Roaen Wood in a place they call the Mørkland. The days are short and dark there in the winter, and the brief summers are stormy and wild. Or so it is told by the few who have journeyed to the far edge of the continent. The Mørkland has been forgotten by the kings of Thaeylan and is mostly ignored by the maurading slavers of the Wood. But it is a snowy idyll for the Væringjar, who needn't do much to ward off invaders.

The Væringjar live off of the animals found in the woods and seas around them. For most of the year they settle in small villages, bound together in clans by oath and kin. But in lean years they must migrate to follow the herds and this brings the clans into conflict. The fractious, bloody fueds of the Væringjar are quick, treacherous affairs, and their history is full of the names of clans gone to memory.

Indeed, the people of the Mørkland rarely speak of themselves as Væringjar at all. They are first and foremost clanfolk, and each clan is its own people. In some, men and women are expected to fight and lead as equals. In others, women are all but chattel. But these differences are set aside each summer, when the clans gather for an annual festival in the west. And no man or woman of any clan would interfere with the sacred burial grounds of Ildenfjell. In these matters, and these matters alone, the Væringjar remain a common people."
