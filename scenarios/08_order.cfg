In some places, the wardens found so many of their acolytes working for the Order that they feared suspicion might fall on them. Instead of expelling the wayward clerics, they quietly protected them, along with their own reputations. In other places, the wardens themselves were involved in the Order.

So he drew no suspicion when he visited the chasm at Thaeylan, where Ephroem had been killed. The dark wizard was long dead, but father believed he was trying to bring the necromancer back to life. The final entry in his journal was scribbled in frantic strokes, in a broken hand that was difficult to decipher. But it was clear that he thought Daerogyn had succeeded in this aim. It was only a matter of time before a new army would rise and sweep south again, threatening everyone in the Thaeylan kingdom."
