			story= _ "Once the heat of battle had cooled, Aowyn and Laeka were guided to the chief's hut, set down beside a warm fire and fed. Safe from the winds outside, Rig began to tell the story of the clerics."
		[/part]
		[part]
			show_title=no
			story= _ "<span style='italic'>The white robes started coming to the MÃ¸rkland when I was a wee lad. Always they were asking about the Oerbrae, these old stone monuments that lie all about up here. No one knows what they are or why they're here. But these clerics paid well for any shards with a runic inscription. Many of my kin grew rich in silver and steel.</span>"
		[/part]
		[part]
			show_title=no
			story= _ "<span style='italic'>Then one day they paid a big clan to take them o'er to Ildenfjell, our sacred burial ground in the east. We never saw them again. But we knew they were still about. The dead we left to rot in the ground would wander back into our villages. And the clouds over Ildenfjell grew thicker every year. And then the horde! We only had to fight the strays that wandered west, but the land was scoured wherever the returners went.</span>"
		[/part]
		[part]
			show_title=no
			story= _ "<span style='italic'>When Nivyan came to us, we learned of the awful fight in the south and understood our part in it. We wanted to leave things alone, but Nivyan insisted on going east. He said it'd all happen again if we didn't dig out the roots. He didn't want the clerics to know he was still chasing them, so a small group from the clan took him east and we were sworn to secrecy. But they never returned.</span>"
		[/part]
		[part]
			show_title=no
			story= _ "When the questions had finished, it was agreed that they would go to Ildenfjell, with a larger company of fighters this time, to learn the fate of Nivyan and to put an end to the order. The barrels were tapped and songs were sung. In the heat of the crowded hut, noisy with drink and laughter, Aowyn sat and watched the room. She had never felt more alone in all her life."
