# Order of Oerbrae

A campaign for [The Battle for Wesnoth](https://www.wesnoth.org/). Learn more about this addon on the [Wesnoth forums](https://forums.wesnoth.org/viewtopic.php?t=55565).

## Description

When a young cleric discovers corruption in the high offices of Vaerya, she must flee her home in the city and seek the protection of a secretive community of smugglers.

Will she elude the Warden's soldiers and find the answers she wants? Her quest will take her to the far coast, beyond the Roaen Wood, as she uncovers the truth about the Order and, maybe, what really happened to her father.

This is a sequal to [Betrayal of Thaeylan](https://forums.wesnoth.org/viewtopic.php?t=331060).
